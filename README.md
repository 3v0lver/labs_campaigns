# Guardicore Labs' IOC Repository



[Guardicore Labs](https://www.guardicore.com/labs) is a team of security experts, hackers and malware researchers.

As part of our ongoing threat intelligence research, we decided to use this public repository to share indicators of compromise (IOCs), 
detection tools and additional information on attack campaigns that we uncover and monitor.

If you found detected one of the IOCs in this repository on your machine - don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:labs@guardicore.com). :mailbox_with_mail:

Many of the IOCs can be viewed in more detail in Guardicore [Cyber Threat Intelligence](https://threatintelligence.guardicore.com) 
website, which we update on a weekly basis.

where we share our research findings.__
